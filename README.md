This is a mod for [Minetest][1]. It implements a tool for shifting nodes as with
the pistons from [Mesecons][2]. It actually uses the API of `mesecons_mvps`,
meaning that it is quite compatible with other mods (the API is widely used.)

To push a node, left-click the face you want to push while wielding the shifter.
To pull the node, right-click the face instead.

### Sounds

The sounds are not by me. See the end of the Attribution section.

## Attribution

### Tool texture and screenshot.png

The texture can be found in [shifter\_tool\_shifter.png][4].
[screenshot.png][5] has the same attribution since it is a scaled-up version of
the texture.

#### Tool handle texture

The texture of the shifter tool handle is a modified part of another texture:
"[default\_tool\_steelaxe.png][6]" by [BlockMen][7] is licensed under a
[CC BY-SA 3.0 license][3]. It is copyrighted as follows:

    Copyright (C) 2010-2018 BlockMen

(The above notice is slightly different from what appears in [license.txt][8].)

#### Tool head texture

The yellow color on the head of the tool is taken from
"[mesecons\_piston\_pusher\_front\_sticky.png][9]" by Vanessa Dannenberg
([VanessaE][10],) which is licensed under a [CC BY-SA 3.0 license][3].
I couldn't find a copyright notice, but here is the notice in Mesecons'
[COPYING.txt][11]:

### Pushing and pulling sounds

[shifter\_tool\_push.ogg][12] and [shifter\_tool\_pull.ogg][13] are unmodified
copies of "[piston\_extend.ogg][14]" and "[piston\_retract.ogg][15]",
respectively. Both of these are by suzenako, and both are licensed under a
[CC BY-SA 3.0 license][3]. Again, this is part of the Mesecons modpack, so the
only copyright notice I could find is this:
